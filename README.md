 PCB

The PCB is also very straightforward. The board is two layers, with a ground pour on the bottom-most layer. The top layer is where all signal/power routing is done. The board features three outputs at the bottom. These outputs are 2.54mm THT holes, designed for soldering with simple jumper cables.
